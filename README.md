About the Scripts:
-----------------

The sample scripts provided allow for easily completing many tasks associated with hosting dedicated game-servers.

This includes things such as:
 * Installing the game-servers in a consistent manner.
 * Running the game-servers interactively at the console for testing / troubleshooting.
 * Starting the game-servers as disconnected / back-ground processes - so that they can run unattended.
 * Stopping the disconnected / back-ground processes of the game-servers.
 * Manually updating the game-servers if needed.
 * Checking for updates available for the game-servers, and conditionally updating the game-servers, restarting them only if an update is needed.
 * Monitoring game-servers running under GNU screen for fatal errors, and automatically restarting - only if needed.
 * Making backups of the game-servers.
 * Generating lists of "stock" content to exclude from backups.

About the Author:
----------------

I have been hosting dedicated game-servers for various Valve software game titles, since late 1999 or early 2000 - long before there was any such thing a "Steam".
I switched from attempting to host game-servers on Windows to Linux, some time in the early 2000's.
I recently completely re-wrote all my Linux (bash) scripts used for management of my dedicated game-servers, in the last couple of months (early 2024).
When I re-wrote everything, I tried to make them less proprietary, and more easily re-usable by other people needing similar scripts.

Optionally, If you find them useful, please feel free to let me know you are using them.
If you do not find them useful, no need to post anything or reach-out. Good luck in your endeavors.

The full "Guide", for how to implement these scripts is available on Steam, here:
